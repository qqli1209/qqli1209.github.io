		<h3>
		Highlights from a recent vacation to Rome, Italy. Shot with a Canon HG10, edited with Final Cut Express. Music is &ldquo;First Breath After Coma&rdquo; by Explosions in the Sky. Typeface is Gotham by Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones.
		</h3>
		<p>
		I&rsquo;m no video virtuoso. I only dabble with video as time allows, which it usually doesn&rsquo;t. But this is one short film I managed to get lucky with.</p>
		<p>
		I&rsquo;ve had a passion for film production ever since I was young. I saw myself first as a stuntman, then later as a film score composer. My time has passed on the first, but I hope I still have a shot at the second sometime in life. In more recent years, I&rsquo;ve found myself behind the camera and in the editor&rsquo;s chair. I have much to learn about what it takes to shoot and edit and a great film.</p>
		<p>
		If there&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;ve done right since purchasing my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000U8HBRW?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=authenticbore-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000U8HBRW">Canon HG10</a> last year, it&rsquo;s to shoot far more film than I think I&rsquo;ll need. That&rsquo;s how I got lucky with "Roma Italia". I shot more angles than I figured I&rsquo;d need, and I left the camera running longer than I assumed was adequate. It paid off in the end, leaving me with five minutes of solid shots from a total of roughly two hours of footage.</p>
		<p>
		I had no script for this piece, and there were only a few shots I planned beforehand to use in whatever the final film would become. The rest was editing mojo. I analyzed the material I had, pieced it together in way I felt told a compelling story, and added effects that complimented the storytelling. &ldquo;<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Explosions+in+the+Sky/_/First+Breath+After+Coma">First Breath After Coma</a>&rdquo;, a moving and driving piece by instrumental rock band <a href="http://www.explosionsinthesky.com/">Explosions in the Sky</a>, was a perfect fit. Not only is it the best song title ever, but its story matches that of &rdquo;Roma Italia&rdquo;: One of awakening, surprise, and climatic rush and release.</p>
		<p>	
		In the end, I hope you enjoy the story. It&rsquo;s a chance to see the magnificent city of Rome through my eyes. Perhaps it&rsquo;ll encourage you to see it through yours.</p>
